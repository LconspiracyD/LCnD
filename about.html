                    This website was made because I don't have what to do, so I decided to make a 
                    website where I showcase my CS:GO Inventory and also being a London Conspiracy Sticker
                    Collector, here I showcase my Collection. Some of my socials are in the nav-bar, so if you want
                    to support me, don't hesitate to do that. Thank you for visiting my website and hope you like it :)
